# Fake-News-Detector
This is an advanced python project ,a model that accurately classify whether a piece of news is REAL or FAKE.
Using sklearn I built up a TfidfVectorizer then initialise a PassiveAggresiveClassifier and fit the model. In the end ,the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us about how well the model fares.
I got to know about the Passive Aggressive Algorithms, TfidfVectorizer, Confusion Matrix through this project.
Also while working on this project I got some basic knowlegde of Numpy, pandas and sklearn...
